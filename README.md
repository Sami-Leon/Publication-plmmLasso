# plmmLasso: Variable selection and Inference for Partial Linear Mixed-Effects 

Welcome to the repository containing the implementation of a Partial Linear Mixed-Effects (PLMM) algorithm designed for longitudinal data analysis. This method allows for modeling nonlinear functions within a mixed-effects framework. Below are the key components of this repository:

Code/CreateBases.R: The R script contains functions dedicated to generating the basis functions used in modeling nonlinear relationships.

Code/CreateSim.R: The R script contains functions to simulate datasets. Additionally, it includes a function named "plot.fit" designed to visualize estimated trajectories and nonlinear functions against the true values from the simulated data.

Code/example.R: An illustrative R script demonstrating the usage of the implemented algorithm using a simulated dataset.

Code/modelselection.R: The R script contains a function that runs our method for various hyperparameter values, calculates selection criteria (BIC, BICC, or EBIC), and returns the model associated with the lowest selected criterion.

Code/plmmlasso.R: The R script contains the main function "plmmlasso" for fitting the model using the PLMM algorithm.

Code/posi.R: The R script contains the function debias.plmm enabling post-selection inference on the fixed-effects generated by the plmmlasso function.

Code/test.nonlinear.functions.R: The R script contains functions to compute bootstrapped p-values for the overall test of equality of the nonlinear functions and bootstrapped joint confidence intervals for the difference between the nonlinear functions.
